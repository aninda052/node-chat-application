# Chat Application With MERN Stack

This is a pet project for learing MERN Stack. I followed [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WC-g0JtEIwM&list=PLHiZ4m8vCp9PHnOIT7gd30PCBoYCpGoQM&index=1&ab_channel=LearnwithSumit-LWS-Bangladesh) tutorial for learning MERN Stack.

I followed the tutorial, but i tried to implement the same functionality on my own. I used exact html/css code that are given in the tutorial, as my primery objective is to understand MERN Stack.

#### Further Development

The tutorial will help you to develop chat application. As my primery objective is to learn about MERN stack, i'll develop this application a bit further. What i'll going to do -

- Dockerize Full Application
- Build CI/CD Pipeline Using Git Action
- Use Nginx As Web Server
- Use RabbitMQ As Message Broker
- Integrate Elastic Search for searching mechanism
